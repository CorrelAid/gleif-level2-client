# GLEIF Level-2 Visualization (Client)

The code was written during a hackathon between [GLEIF](https://www.gleif.org/) and [CorrelAid](https://www.correlaid.org). :rocket: The goal of the project was to visualize relational data between legal entites that are registered at GLEIF. More information about the open data available at GLEIF can be found here: [https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-data/access-and-use-lei-data](https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-data/access-and-use-lei-data). Furthermore, an introductory blog post can be found here: [https://correlaid.org/en/blog/gleif-hackathon/](https://correlaid.org/en/blog/gleif-hackathon/).

This is the client of the project the server backend can be found here: [https://github.com/CorrelAid/gleif-level2-server](https://github.com/CorrelAid/gleif-level2-server).

## Current Limitations

Due to the nature of hackthons the current version of the tool includes the following limitations:

- The documentation of the code might be partially incomplete. If you come across an issue please file an issue within this repository.
- The backend reacts quiet slowly due to the design decisions.
- Some edge-cases are not handeled.
