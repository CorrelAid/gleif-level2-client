# GLEIF Level-2 Visualization (Server)

The code was written during a hackathon between [GLEIF](https://www.gleif.org/) and [CorrelAid](https://www.correlaid.org). :rocket: The goal of the project was to visualize relational data between legal entitles that are registered at GLEIF. More information about the open data available at GLEIF can be found here: [https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-data/access-and-use-lei-data](https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-data/access-and-use-lei-data). Furthermore, an introductory blog post can be found here: [https://correlaid.org/en/blog/gleif-hackathon/](https://correlaid.org/en/blog/gleif-hackathon/).

This is the server of the project the client can be found here: [https://github.com/CorrelAid/gleif-level2-client](https://github.com/CorrelAid/gleif-level2-client).

## Limitations

Due to the nature of hackathons the current version of the tool includes the following limitations:

- The documentation of the code might be partially incomplete. If you come across an issue, please file an issue within this repository.
- The backend reacts quite slowly due to the focus on functionality during the hackathon.
- There might be some edge-cases that are not yet handled.
